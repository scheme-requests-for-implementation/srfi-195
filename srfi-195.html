    <h1>Title</h1>

    Multiple value boxes

    <h1>Author</h1>

    <p>Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen</p>

    <h1>Status</h1>

    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      This SRFI extends the specification of the boxes
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI
	111</a> so that they are multiple-values aware.  Whereas a SRFI
      111 box is limited in that it can only box a single value,
      multiple values can be boxed with this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h1>Issues</h1>

    <p>There are currently no issues.</p>

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>
      At its core, Scheme's evaluation semantics is multiple-value
      based.  Continuations can accept an arbitrary number of values and
      expressions can yield an arbitrary number of values.  This is
      contrast to the functional languages ML and Haskell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite this fact, programming with multiple values is more
      cumbersome than programming with single values.  This is mostly
      due to the fact that Scheme's application syntax does not deal
      directly with operands returning multiple values so that the
      programmer has to fall back on things
      like <code>call-with-values</code>.  It is, however, also partly
      due to the fact that a lot of Scheme's procedures have been
      modelled on a language that does not have multiple values.
    </p>

    <p>
      One example for this are the procedures exported by SRFI 111.
      In an ongoing attempt to make Scheme more uniform (and therefore
      also simpler) and so that multiple values feel less like a
      second-class citizen, this SRFI extends SRFI 111 so that it
      becomes multiple-values-aware in a natural way.  The naturalness
      of the extension is a proof that it is the right extension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boxes of this SRFI can be used to reify the concept of
      multiple values into a first-class single value.  This can be
      used in the implementation of SRFIs
      like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-189/srfi-189.html">SRFI
      189</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Multiple-value-aware boxes as described in this SRFI form a
      natural Scheme monad as much as the monads defined in SRFI 165
      and SRFI 189 do.  However, it is left to a future SRFI to
      describe a monadic interface to boxes (the monadic pure would be
      the <code>box</code> procedure; the monadic join would
      be <code>unbox</code> when restricted to boxes whose values
      consist of a single box).
    </p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <p>In a Scheme system supporting both SRFI 111 and this SRFI, the
      bindings exported by both SRFIs have to be equivalent.</p>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>

    <p>The following procedures implement the box type (which is disjoint
      from all other Scheme types), and are exported by
      the <code>(srfi 111)</code> and <code>(srfi 195)</code>
      libraries.
    </p>

    <p><code>(box <var>value</var> …)</code></p>

    <p>
      Constructor. Returns a newly allocated box initialized to
      the <code><var>value</var></code>s.
    </p>

    <p><code>(box? <var>object</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Predicate. Returns <code>#t</code>
      if <code><var>object</var></code> is a box, and <code>#f</code>
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>(unbox <var>box</var>)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Accessor. Returns the current values of <code><var>box</var></code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>(set-box! <var>box</var> <var>value</var> …)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mutator. Changes <code><var>box</var></code> to
      hold <code><var>value</var></code>s.
    </p>

    <p>
      The behavior of boxes with the equivalence
      predicates <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>,
      and <code>equal?</code> is the same as if they were implemented
      with records. That is, two boxes are both <code>eq?</code>
      and <code>eqv?</code> iff they are the product of the same call
      to box and not otherwise, and while they must
      be <code>equal?</code> if they are <code>eqv?</code>, the
      converse is implementation-dependent.

    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>A simple, portable R7RS-implementation of <code>(srfi
      195)</code> and a compatible <code>(srfi 111)</code> is given in
      the repository of this SRFI.
    </p>

      specification section, I stole its language.
