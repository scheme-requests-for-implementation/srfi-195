    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This SRFI extends the specification of the boxes
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI
	111</a> so that they are multiple-values aware.  Whereas a SRFI
      111 box is limited in that it can only box a single value,
      multiple values can be boxed with this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <p>There are currently no issues.</p>

    <h2>Rationale</h2>

    <p>
      At its core, Scheme's evaluation semantics is multiple-value
      based.  Continuations can accept an arbitrary number of values and
      expressions can yield an arbitrary number of values.  This is
      contrast to the functional languages ML and Haskell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite this fact, programming with multiple values is more
      cumbersome than programming with single values.  This is mostly
      due to the fact that Scheme's application syntax does not deal
      directly with operands returning multiple values so that the
      programmer has to fall back on things
      like <code>call-with-values</code>.  It is, however, also partly
      due to the fact that a lot of Scheme's procedures have been
      modelled on a language that does not have multiple values.
    </p>

    <p>
      One example for this are the procedures exported by SRFI 111.
      In an ongoing attempt to make Scheme more uniform (and therefore
      also simpler) and so that multiple values feel less like a
      second-class citizen, this SRFI extends SRFI 111 so that it
      becomes multiple-values-aware in a natural way.  The naturalness
      of the extension is a proof that it is the right extension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boxes of this SRFI can be used to reify the concept of
      multiple values into a first-class single value.  This can be
      used in the implementation of SRFIs
      like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-189/srfi-189.html">SRFI
      189</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Multiple-value-aware boxes as described in this SRFI form a
      natural Scheme monad as much as the monads defined in SRFI 165
      and SRFI 189 do.  However, it is left to a future SRFI to
      describe a monadic interface to boxes (the monadic pure would be
      the <code>box</code> procedure; the monadic join would
      be <code>unbox</code> when restricted to boxes whose values
      consist of a single box).
    </p>

    <p>
      In a number of use cases, the multiple-valued boxes of this
      SRFI may be used interchangeably with vectors or lists.  In
      general, however, they are different things:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The constructors <code>(list)</code>
        and <code>(vector)</code> do not have to return a newly
        allocated object each time, but the constructor <code>(box)</code>
        does.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vectors are optimized for random access of single elements.
        Boxes, on the other hand, are supposed to be implemented in a
        way such that setting all values at once and passing all
        values at once to a continuation are efficient.  For example,
        the boxes of this SRFI are the natural candidate to implement
        the Justs, Lefts, and Rights of SRFI 189.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lists and vectors are usually viewed as sequences (of single
        values) whose lengths are the length of the underlying list
        or vector.  A box, however, shall be viewed as a sequence (of
        multiple values) of length one much like the Justs, Lefts, and
        Rights of SRFI 189.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contrary to vectors and lists, a box shall convey the meaning
        of multiple value reified as a single value, whereas packing
        and unpacking (i.e. boxing and unboxing) from and into
        multiple values shall be as efficient as possible.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of writing explicit iterations, the use of higher-order
      functions like <code>fold</code> of SRFI is often simpler and
      clearer.  While one can pass an arbitrary number of values from
      one step to the next in an iteration, the <code>fold</code>
      procedure only allows one, initially
      called <code><var>knil</var></code> in SRFI 1.  The reason is
      that <code>fold</code> and the folding
      procedure <code><var>kons</var></code> are already of variable
      arity in the number of lists to fold over.
    </p>

    <p>
      By reifying the concept of multiple values as a single value, a
      variant of <code>fold</code>, dubbed <code>fold*</code>, can be
      specified that allows passing an arbitrary (but fixed) number of
      values from one step to the next of the iteration.  The
      following is an implementation written for clarity and not speed:
    </p>

    <pre>
(define (fold* kons* knil* clist . clist*)
  (unbox (apply fold
                (lambda args
                  (call-with-values (lambda () (apply kons* args)) box))
                knil*
                clist
                clist*)))</pre>

    <p>
      Here, <code><var>knil*</var></code> is a box reifying the seed
      states and <code><var>kons*</var></code> is a procedure
      taking <var>n</var> + 1 parameters, one element from each list, and the
      fold states reified into a box, and returns the next seed states
      as multiple values.
    </p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
(fold* (lambda (e b)
         (receive (lis n) (unbox b)
           (values (cons e lis) (+ 1 n))))
       (box '() 0) '(1 2 3 4 5))</pre>

    <p>evaluates to two values, <code>'(5 4 3 2 1)</code> and <code>5</code>.</p>

    <h2>Specification</h2>

    <p>In a Scheme system supporting both SRFI 111 and this SRFI, the
      bindings that are exported by both SRFIs have to be the
      same.</p>

    <h3>Boxes</h3>

    <p>The following procedures implement the box type (which is disjoint
      from all other Scheme types) and are exported by
      the <code>(srfi 111)</code> and <code>(srfi 195)</code>
      libraries.
    </p>

    <p><code>(box <var>value</var> …)</code></p>

    <p>
      Constructor. Returns a newly allocated box initialized to
      the <code><var>value</var></code>s.
    </p>

    <p><code>(box? <var>object</var>)</code></p>

    <p>
      Predicate. Returns <code>#t</code>
      if <code><var>object</var></code> is a box, and <code>#f</code>
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>(unbox <var>box</var>)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Accessor. Returns the current values of <code><var>box</var></code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>(set-box! <var>box</var> <var>value</var> …)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mutator. Changes <code><var>box</var></code> to
      hold <code><var>value</var></code>s.  It is an error
      if <code>set-box!</code> is called with a number of values that
      differs from the number of values in the box being set.  (In
      other words, <code>set-box!</code> does not allocate memory.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The behavior of boxes with the equivalence
      predicates <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>,
      and <code>equal?</code> is the same as if they were implemented
      with records. That is, two boxes are both <code>eq?</code>
      and <code>eqv?</code> iff they are the product of the same call
      to box and not otherwise, and while they must
      be <code>equal?</code> if they are <code>eqv?</code>, the
      converse is implementation-dependent.
    </p>

    <h3>Introspection</h3>

    <p>
      The following procedures are exported by <code>(srfi 195)</code>
      library.
    </p>

    <p><code>(box-arity <var>box</var>)</code></p>
    <p>Accessor. Returns the number of values
      of <code><var>box</var></code>.</p>

    <p><code>(unbox-value <var>box</var> <var>i</var>)</code></p>
    <p>Accessor. Returns the <code><var>i</var></code>th value
    of <code><var>box</var></code>.  It is an error
    if <code><var>i</var></code> is not an exact integer between 0
    and <var>n</var> - 1, when <var>n</var> is the number of values
    of <code><var>box</var></code>.</p>

    <p><code>(set-box-value! <var>box</var> <var>i</var> <var>obj</var>)</code></p>
    <p>Mutator. Changes the <code><var>i</var></code>th value
    of <code><var>box</var></code> to <code><var>obj</var></code>.  It
    is an error if <code><var>i</var></code> is not an exact integer
    between 0 and <var>n</var> - 1, when <var>n</var> is the number of
    values of <code><var>box</var></code>.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <p>A simple, portable R7RS-implementation of <code>(srfi
      195)</code> and a compatible <code>(srfi 111)</code> is given in
      the <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-195">repository
      of this SRFI</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Scheme implementers are encouraged to provide fast specialized
      implementations of preferences of the SRFI 111 procedures.</p>

    <p>By way of an example, the implementation in the repository of
      this SRFI contains specialized code for Chibi-Scheme.</p>
